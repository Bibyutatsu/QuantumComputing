# QuantumComputing
Small algorithms and implementations of Quantum Computing algorithms.

I have created two folders which contains small dummy algoritms I am working on for learning Quantum Computing and also experimenting with various parameters.

- `Quantum Annealing` : This folder contains algorithms implemented on Dwave Leap platform
- `Quantum Gate` : This folder contains algorithms implemented using Qiskit (**WIP**)
